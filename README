Need to change 'app' to whatever your app name is in the following places:

1. app/ dir.
2. urls.py
3. app/urls.py
4. app/views.py
5. app/templates/app/ dir.
6. app/templates/app/home.html
7. app/templates/django_rpx_plus/*.html

For South, after you rename the app, need to run:
./manage.py schemamigration appname --initial
